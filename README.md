## 1 - Overview
* "My Loan Amortization" is loan repayment scheduler enabling you to plan, track, and adjust how much you're paying each period.  You can schedule routine "pre-payments to principle" on top of the regular period payments to reduce the total interest paid out and the lifespan of the loan.  You can even track the occasional one-off extra pre-payments.
* The tool is simple to use.  All the formulas are done for you. Just fill out the six Loan Parameters in yellow boxes at the upper left corner of the spreadsheet, and everything else will be auto-calculated.  You can alter the paramters to try out different scenarios.  You can even go type in "one-off" pre-payments down in the schedule for accurate change tracking.
* View the Graphs tab to see a standard "Loan Amortization Chart" depicting remaining balance, principle, and interest paid at any given point in the life of the loan.  There is also a "Payment Type" graph comparing total interest as originally scheduled versus after pre-payments have been applied.  

## 2 - Quick Start Guide

### 2.1 - Legend
The general rule is that you only type into light yellow cells, and only on the first worksheet "Amortization Schedule".  Everything else is a calculated cell.
